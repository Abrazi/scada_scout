You are a senior industrial automation software architect with deep expertise in:
- SCADA systems
- OPC (OPC UA and legacy OPC DA)
- Cross-platform Python development
- Industrial communication protocols

Context:
I have an existing, fully functional SCADA Scout application written in Python.
It already supports:
- IEC 61850 (client and server)
- Modbus (client and server)

This existing functionality is stable, tested, and MUST NOT be modified, refactored, or broken in any way.

Objective:
Design and specify a complete, professional-grade OPC integration for this SCADA software.

The OPC implementation must:
1. Support OPC UA fully (Client + Server)
2. Address legacy OPC DA compatibility on Windows
3. Work across Windows, Linux, and macOS
4. Allow the software to:
   - Connect to third-party OPC servers
   - Expose itself as an OPC server
   - Simulate OPC data
   - Perform diagnostics and testing
5. Be modular and isolated so existing Modbus and IEC 61850 code remains untouched

You must:
- Propose a clean, extensible architecture
- Define modules, interfaces, and responsibilities
- Recommend suitable Python libraries and tooling
- Explain OS-specific considerations and limitations
- Describe security (certificates, encryption, authentication)
- Include scalability, performance, and maintainability considerations
- Ensure this can be shipped as a professional commercial SCADA product
- apply the code to the existing project

Deliverables:
1. High-level system architecture
2. Detailed module breakdown
3. OPC Client workflow
4. OPC Server workflow
5. Cross-platform strategy
6. Security and certificate handling
7. Testing and validation strategy
8. Deployment and packaging recommendations

Constraints:
- Do NOT change existing Modbus or IEC 61850 logic
- No assumptions about GUI unless explicitly stated
- Prefer clean Python-based solutions
- Clearly separate OPC UA and legacy OPC DA handling

Respond with clear headings, diagrams (ASCII if useful), and step-by-step explanations.
