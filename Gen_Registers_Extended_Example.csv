# Extended Gen_Registers.csv Format Example
# This example shows the extended format with data types, endianness, scale, and offset
# 
# Columns:
# - IsEnabled: true/false (whether this register is active)
# - Index: Register index (0-based)
# - PointType: 1=Coil, 2=Discrete, 3=Input Register, 4=Holding Register
# - Name: Register name/identifier
# - Description: Human-readable description
# - Direction: Input/Output/None (for documentation)
# - Value: Default value
# - Quality: Default quality (0=good)
# - DataType: Optional - UINT16, INT16, FLOAT32, etc. (defaults to UINT16)
# - Endianness: Optional - BIG_ENDIAN, LITTLE_ENDIAN, etc. (defaults to BIG_ENDIAN)
# - Scale: Optional - Multiply factor for value conversion (defaults to 1.0)
# - Offset: Optional - Offset for value conversion (defaults to 0.0)
#
# Example: For a temperature sensor reading in 0.1°C increments stored as UINT16
#          - Raw value: 235 (register value)
#          - Scale: 0.1
#          - Offset: 0
#          - Actual value: 235 * 0.1 + 0 = 23.5°C
