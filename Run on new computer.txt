Here’s the clean, reliable way to do it 👇

1️⃣ Don’t activate the copied venv (important)

A venv contains absolute paths to:

the old Python install

system libraries

OS-specific binaries

So activating it on a new computer often fails or behaves weirdly.

✅ Best practice: delete the old venv folder
(or just ignore it)

2️⃣ Make sure Python is installed

On the new computer, check:

python --version


or (sometimes):

python3 --version

ption A: Upgrade Python (best) 

Install Python 3.10 or 3.11 on the new computer

Delete the venv:

rmdir /s /q venv


Recreate it:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate


Upgrade pip:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip


Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt


✅ This keeps your dependencies exactly as intended.

If that fails, install Python from python.org first.

3️⃣ Create a new virtual environment

From your project root (where your code lives):

macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv

Windows
python -m venv venv


This creates a fresh venv for this machine.

4️⃣ Activate the new venv
macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Windows (cmd)
venv\Scripts\activate


You’ll know it worked when you see:

(venv)


at the start of your terminal line.

5️⃣ Reinstall dependencies

If your project has a requirements.txt (hopefully 🤞):

pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don’t have one and the old computer is still available:

pip freeze > requirements.txt


Then move that file over and install again.

6️⃣ Run your program

Example:

python main.py


or whatever your entry file is.
